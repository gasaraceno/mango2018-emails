## Jarvis Invitation

Hello Jarvis!

Hey Brian,

I hope recruitment season has been treating you well. Over here at FIU, we are getting ready to throw our Spring Hackathon and I am wondering if there is any person I can reach out to for sponsorship. I assume that the recruitment cycle is near over, but it would be the perfect chance for FIU intern/full time hires to interact with engineers to consider Snapchat for a Fall or Spring cycle.

Because MangoHacks is on it's third iteration, we are expecting 400 students and plenty of new freshmen and sophmores who can become accustomed to Snapchat's hiring pipeline. So when it is time, the process is easy and simple. We also tend to attract many business students who come to learn about to tech making it a great place to promote any Business Analyst positions.

If this sounds like something Snapchat would be interested I would love to hop on a call when you are free. I can do [time] on [day] if that works best.

Con Sabor,

Angelo Saraceno
