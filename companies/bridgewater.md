## Yuan Followup

Hello Yuan, 

Things have been a little hectic with playing catchup from my classes. When our school went through Hurricane Irma, my classes' exam shedules were all sorts of messed up. At least so far I have been able to catch up. Regretfully, I wasn't able to join you and some students for some dinner but I am sure in my travels we can catch up in person.

The proposition of working for a fund like Bridgewater where the clients aren't just folks who set up risky plays with other people's money where the meaning even extends to people's pensions and instruental support systems for many unions and public workers is something I find extremely fufilling.

I would be interested in working on DevOps or Project Management depending on whatever is availible. Enclosed is my resume.

P.S. I remember you mentioned that the fund might be interested in sponsoring MangoHacks, it would definitely be a source of unconventional talent and brand exposure. If you are interested I have also enclosed a prospectus.
