## Microsoft < > MangoHacks

Hey Brian,

I hope recruitment season has been treating you well. I first want to thank you for the opportunity that you have provided that allowed me interview with Microsoft in the first place. Right now as a I prepare for my second round interview I have a brief question to ask. Over here at FIU, we are getting ready to throw our Spring Hackathon and I am wondering if there is any person I can reach out to for sponsorship of MangoHacks. I assume that the recruitment cycle is over, but it would be the perfect chance for FIU intern/full time hires to interact with Evangelists from Microsoft to become familiar with the technical stack before they head off to Redmond. 

Because MangoHacks is on it's third iteration, we are expecting 400 students and plenty of new freshmen and sophmores who can become accustomed to Microsoft's hiring pipeline. So when it is time, the process is easy and simple. We also tend to attract many business students who come to learn about to tech making it a great place to promote any Business Analyst positions.

If this sounds like something Microsft would be interested I would love to hop on a call when you are free. I can do [time] on [day] if that works best.

Con Sabor,

Angelo Saraceno
