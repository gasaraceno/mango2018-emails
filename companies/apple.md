## Apple Cold Email

Hello [Person]

On February 2016, I went to my first hackathon in Florida State University. I did not know how to seriously code, I did not know anybody within Computer Science and I sure didn't know how to approach any person for mentorship.

Yet there Apple was, the cohosting sponsor on HackFSU with a lounge full of Core OS engineers, security experts, and Product Managers talking shop about life, and the pursuit of the most perfect product. I was able to meet Myke Olsen, someone who was able to profoundly have a dramatic impact on my career.

After that fateful hackathon, I went on to go 18 different events across the country, winning 8 Top 3 places, and winning numerous accolades for my work. However, this isn't my story, but the story about one Apple's impact on the student developer community. Because of that, I wanted to replicate that moment with with MangoHacks the last two years. 

This year, I would like to extend Apple the opportunity for the same opportunity to bring momentus change in the life of student creators, developers, and managers. It is a opportunity to reach 400 students accross the country in the most ethinically diverse city in the country.

This year, join our mission to make students in FIU, Florida, and the greater college community to imagine, innovate and inspire this February 2nd to the 4th, 2018. 

We would love to hear back and see a new partnership blossom.

Con Sabor,
