## Clifton Followup

Hello Clifton,

I am writing as a followup in regards with our initial contact when your team visited FIU.

MangoHacks is happening in February 2nd and the 4th and it will be a great opportunity to collaborate in hosting a event like the office hours done two years ago.

If this is something Uber would like to do, we can reached at this email or team@mangohacks.com

And if you are free around [time and day] we can hop on a call and discuss specifics.

Con Sabor,
