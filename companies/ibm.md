## IBM + IBM Design + IBM Blockchain < > MangoHacks

Hey [],

Apologies, I was unable to respond earlier- apparently it got buried. 

I am introducing you folks to Krista, our current ACM president, I am sure many students would be interested in doing evangelism on behalf of IBM. Already, it seems like BlueMix is the first API of choice at MangoHacks and at Shellhacks.

We would love to continuine IBM's presence on campus and we want to make it so that your contunued support of our event brings you plenty of value. 

(Considering bringing IBM back for the same workshops and amendities on a lower cost considering they have been supporting mangohacks for 2 + years)
