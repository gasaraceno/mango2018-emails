## Facebook < > MangoHacks

Hello Ernesto!

I hope recruitment season has been treating you well. I first want to thank you for the opportunity that you have provided that is allowing me to interview with Facebook in the first place. The experience that I was able to get from going to @Scale has really opened my perspective. Over here at FIU, we are getting ready to throw our Spring Hackathon and I am wondering if there is any person I can reach out to in regards for sponsorship of MangoHacks. 

Because MangoHacks is on it's third iteration, we are expecting 400 students and plenty of new freshmen and sophmores who can become accustomed to Facebook's hiring pipeline. It is also a great opportunity to send software engineers and evangelists to promote development on top of Facebook's rich developer ecosystem. As well it is a great opportunity to promote many of the full-time oppourtunities availible at Facebook's companies.

If this sounds like something Microsft would be interested I would love to hop on a call when you are free. I can do [time] on [day] if that works best.

Con Sabor,

Angelo Saraceno
