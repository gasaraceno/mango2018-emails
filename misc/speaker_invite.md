Hello [Person],

My name is Angelo Saraceno from sunny Miami, Florida. The land of cortaditos, beaches, and The Cuban Sandwich. It is also the home of MangoHacks, Miami's Sweetest Student Hackathon. 

MangoHacks is one of the most impactful events in this city and you can help be a part of that story. We would like you to come and give [the opening talk/a workshop] to around 400 students who come to imagine, learn to innovate, and go on to inspire others.

Hackathons remain one of the foremost ways on to reach an audience that wants to hear the stories of someone who has seen the tech industry envolve the way you have. Making sure that your story is shared is key to making sure that you are able to mentor the next generation of diverse hackers.

If this sounds enticing enough to bring you down to Miami, we would love to have you over for a cortadito on us.

Lets on a call, or contact us at team@mangohacks.com

Con Sabor,

Angelo Saraceno
