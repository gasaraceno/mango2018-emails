Subject: A MangoHacks Introduction

Hello, [Company]!

My name is Angelo Saraceno from sunny Miami, Florida. The land of cortaditos, beaches, and The Cuban Sandwich. It is also the home of MangoHacks, Miami's Sweetest Student Hackathon. 

Florida International University is home to a extremely diverse and creative population of students ranging from enterprising beginners to experienced student developers who have aquired prestigious internships all across multiple companies. You are cordially invited to spend Feb 2nd to the 4th here at Florida International University for a weekend full of imagination, innovation, and inspiration with 400 students all accross the country.

MangoHacks is one of the most impactful events in this city and you can help be a part of that story as you may look to add some flavor to your recruitment, get valuable product feedback or support one of the most accessible introductions to the world that we know as STEM. 

If this sounds like an event you want to support, we would love to hear back from you. You can send an email at team@mangohacks.com or asara019@fiu.edu and shedule a call with us. We want to make this MangoHacks the best one yet, and we can't do it without you.

Con Sabor,

Angelo Saraceno
